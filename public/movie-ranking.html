<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>I like the friendship between the actors. The storyline and compassion for eachother. Also it's very funny</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Do I really need to explain why Shrek is in my top 3 movie list.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I like the creativity behind the movie. The moving castle is cool, and the fire being Howl's heart was a nice twist.</p>
